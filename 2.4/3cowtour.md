## Complete Search

    For gold level, you can do complete search.

## Input
    char matrix[][]  // getline
    int  matrix[][]  // get char by char

## Output

    For float, C++ has precision and fixed for cout.
    float comparison can be a problem.  
    float a=b=x;  (a==b)? true or false, not 100% sure.

    one way to do comparison:
    delta = 0.00000001;
    if (abs(a-b) < delta), they are equal?

## enhancement

    1. how to find the maximum perimeter ?
    2. If there is unknown number of fields, but possibly more than 2 fields, for exmaple, 4 fields ?
