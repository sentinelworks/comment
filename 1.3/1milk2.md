# interval class

struct interval {
    int start, end;

};

## Problem list:

    1. sort interval list: based on start or end
    2. suppose it is sorted interval list:
        a. merge interval list: Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
        b. Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).
