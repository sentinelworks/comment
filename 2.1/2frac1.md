## sorting

## head method

## recursive method

We notice that we can start with 0/1 and 1/1 as our ``endpoints'' and recursively generate the middle points by adding numerators and denominators. 
0/1                                                              1/1
                               1/2
                  1/3                      2/3
        1/4              2/5         3/5                 3/4
    1/5      2/7     3/8    3/7   4/7   5/8       5/7         4/5
